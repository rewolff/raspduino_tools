This repository is called raspduino_tools, because we might
add other stuff later on. But for now it has raspduino-setup
and not much else. 

Run the raspduino-setup script as root to prepare your raspberry
for use with the raspduino. 

It installs
  avrdude
  arduino

It moves avrdude to avrdude.bin
and installs a script that calls the binary after resetting
the raspduino. 

It creates the reset-raspduino script. 

It installs a 80-raspduino-rules that links the ttyAMA0 to ttyS0, 
because the arduino software doesn't expect a serial port to be
called TTYAMA0. 

It removes ttyAMA0 from /etc/inittab. 

It removes ttyAMA from /boot/cmdline.txt. 

It adds the raspduino to the boards.txt file.
